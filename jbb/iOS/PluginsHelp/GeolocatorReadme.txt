**IMPORTANT**
Android:
You must request ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION & ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permission

iOS:
In iOS 8 you now have to call either RequestWhenInUseAuthorization or RequestAlwaysAuthorization on the location manager. Additionally you need to add either the concisely named NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription or NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription to your Info.plist. 
See:  http://motzcod.es/post/97662738237/scanning-for-ibeacons-in-ios-8

You will need to add a new string entry called NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription or NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription.

iOS Background updates:
New in iOS 9 allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates must be set. I have exposed this on the Geolocator via:

var locator = CrossGeolocator.Current;
locator.AllowsBackgroundUpdates = true;

The presence of the UIBackgroundModes key with the location value is required for background updates; you use this property to enable and disable the behavior based on your appï¿½s behavior.

Windows Phone:
You must set the ID_CAP_LOCATION permission.

Getting Started:

Put this code in a method that is marked with the async keyword.

var locator = CrossGeolocator.Current;
locator.DesiredAccuracy = 50;

var position = await locator.GetPositionAsync (timeoutMilliseconds: 10000);

Console.WriteLine ("Position Status: {0}", position.Timestamp);
Console.WriteLine ("Position Latitude: {0}", position.Latitude);
Console.WriteLine ("Position Longitude: {0}", position.Longitude);
