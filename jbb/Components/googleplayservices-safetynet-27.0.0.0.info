Visit the [Google Developers Console][1] to create a project for your application.\n\nOnce you have created a project for your Android app, enable the necessary APIs in the developer console for the Google Play Services APIs you will be using in your app.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you plan on verifying your Attestation results with Google\u0027s servers you will need to enable the *Android Device Verification API*.\n\n\n\nCredentials\n-----------\n\nSome Google Play Services APIs require an *API Key* or an *OAuth 2.0 Client ID* (or both) to be setup to allow your app to make authenticated calls against the API.\n\nIn the Developers Console, in your app\u0027s Project, under the *APIs \u0026 auth* section, go to *Credentials*.\n\n\n\n\n\n### API Key\n\nIf the Google Play Services API you are using requires an API Key:\n\n  1. *Add credentials* button and then *API key*\n  2. Choose *Android key*\n  3. Click *Add package name and fingerprint*\n  4. Enter your android app\u0027s package name as found in your *AndroidManifest.xml* file\n  5. [Find your SHA-1 fingerprints][2]\n  6. Enter your SHA-1 fingerprint of your app\u0027s debug keystore\n  7. Repeat steps 4-6 with the package name and SHA-1 of the keystore file you will be signing your app\u0027s Release builds with\n  8. Click *Create*\n  9. Note the *API key* value you generated\n\nOnce you have your API key value, you will need to add this to your *AndroidManifest.xml* as a metadata value either by directly editing the manifest file, or using an assembly level attribute which will generate the value in the manifest file for you.  The metadata key will be different for each Google Play Services API.  For example, if you are adding it for Maps, you could add this assembly level attribute to your project:\n\n```csharp\n[assembly: MetaData (\"com.google.android.maps.v2.API_KEY\", Value=\"YOUR-API-KEY\")]\n```\n\n\n\n\nSamples\n=======\n\nYou can find a Sample Application within each Google Play Services component.  The sample will demonstrate the necessary configuration and some basic API usages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n==========\n\nYou can learn more about the various Google Play Services SDKs \u0026 APIs by visiting the official [Google APIs for Android][3] documentation\n\n\nYou can learn more by visiting the official [Safety Net API for Android](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/) documentation.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://console.developers.google.com/ \"Google Developers Console\"\n[2]: https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/deployment,_testing,_and_metrics/MD5_SHA1/ \"Finding your SHA-1 Fingerprints\"\n[3]: https://developers.google.com/android/ \"Google APIs for Android\"\n\n","Hash":"956969b116d35f489ce2fdfb2ca03223","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
